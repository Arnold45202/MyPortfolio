        <h2>How did I get into coding?</h2>
        <p>
        So, it might sound a bit wild, but coding wasn't my first go-to. Initially, I thought about diving into the whole med scene because, 
        you know, all my friends were into it. 
        But one day, reality hit, and I realised I didn't actually want to be a doctor. <br />
        Turns out, my heart was in engineering. I've always been that tech kid. Back in the day, during year 9 to 12, I was building computers and fixing phones on the side for money. 
        Tech videos were my jam, and then AI dropped, taking my excitement to a whole new level. <br />
        It wasn't until year 13 that I figured coding was my thing. Took my first computer science course, and bam, fell in love with it. 
        Now, I'm hooked on learning new stuff like React, HTML, CSS, and Python. My school wasn't able to teach me these stuff for my first yaer, but hey, 
        I couldn't wait for the holidays to get my code on, so I started doing it myself!!
